Hi Finn,  
  
In case you forgot what you've acheieved in the future, here are something to look at.  
You done comment in files to explain why and how to do it. And also look up package.json to find out what package to install.  
Mainly you use:  

  ---  
  
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
  - for styling and that's awesome, because it's a really good component library for React.
    - theme setting was cool
  - [data grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) in data layout out and come with awesome functionality. ( sort data, download as scv... etc. )
  - [icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) (kinda like font awesome).
  - [Accordion](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/) basic tool.
  
- [FullCalendar ](https://fullcalendar.io/)
  - a React calendar component to interact with.
  - sorts of plugins to add into calendar component.

- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/)
  - for data present, like pie chart, bar chart, even geography chart!
  - good intro, easy to use.

- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
  - a open source form library for React.
  - use [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for object schema validation.
